Janna focuses on gathering information through the most reliable and cheapest method for all Filipino citizens, SMS. People in emergencies
can set their own danger level, situation and this is sent to a server via Yone, our server that connects with Filipino citizens via
SMS. Janna also sends the risk score based on the survey on the people. Using all this information, it would be possible to create a heatmap 
of the places that require the most assistance through qualitative and quantitative data.
